# sicp-exercises

I'm using the [HTML5 version of the book.](http://sarabander.github.io/sicp/html/index.xhtml#SEC_Contents)

I've also been watching the excellent [video lectures from 1986](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/video-lectures/) also available as a [youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE18841CABEA24090).

For actually evaluating the code, I'm running mit-scheme (i386) on 64-bit Ubuntu 12.04. I'm editing it in Sublime Text 3, and using [SublimeREPL](https://github.com/wuub/SublimeREPL) with a scheme syntax package.

I had to [change the path to the syntax package](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22928696/using-scheme-interpreter-in-sublimerepl-package-in-sublime-text-3) to make SublimeREPL happy. Note that the file changed was inside of SublimeREPL's Scheme directory.
